## Introduction
Core idea:
   The **intelligence** is trained by continuously interacting with the environment, and the intelligence learns how to **optimise circuit parameters by constantly adjusting its own strategies during the training process**.

   Results of having an intelligent body model automatically find a set of circuit parameters：

   The test was repeated 25 times and the results are shown in the figure above.As can be seen from the graphs, the 25 tests of the smartbody were able to find circuit parameters that met the design objectives.As the research progresses factors such as the effect of temperature on the actuation circuit and electromagnetic interference will be incorporated into the optimisation.
